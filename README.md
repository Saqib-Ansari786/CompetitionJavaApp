# Competition Management System (CMS) - Java

This is a simple console-based application that allows users to manage a competition. The competition has a list of participants and a list of judges. The participants are scored by the judges and the scores are used to determine the winner of the competition. In this project I implemented UI using Java Swing. Also, I used file based storage to store the data of the competition.

## Features

- Add, edit, delete, and view participants
- Add, edit, delete, and view judges
- Add, edit, delete, and view scores
- View the winner of the competition
- Save and load the competition data from a file

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
